# Support & Shared Responsibility (CLF-C02)

## Core definitions
- AWS Support Plans: Tiered support offerings (Basic, Developer, Business, Enterprise).
- Shared responsibility model: AWS secures infrastructure; you secure data, identities, and configs.

## Don’t confuse X with Y
- AWS Support vs Trusted Advisor: Support is human help; Trusted Advisor is automated checks.
- Basic vs Developer support: Basic has no technical support; Developer includes email support.
- AWS responsibility vs customer responsibility: AWS handles physical/host layer; customers handle IAM, data, and app security.

## Quick examples
- Use Business Support to get faster response times and 24/7 support.
- Rely on AWS to patch managed services, but you configure access control.
- Use Trusted Advisor to check for idle EC2 or open security groups.
- Use the AWS Well-Architected Tool for workload reviews.
- Know that AWS secures data centers; you secure S3 bucket policies.
